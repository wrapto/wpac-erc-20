# Wrapped PAC (WPAC) Token

Welcome to the repository for the Wrapped PAC (WPAC) token. WPAC is a wrapped token (ERC-20) compatible with all EVM blockchains, providing interoperability for PAC tokens across different networks.

## Project Overview

WPAC tokens are wrapped tokens provided by the Wrapto platform. The token contract is implemented in Solidity and follows the OpenZeppelin Contracts upgradeable pattern. It allows users to bridge PAC tokens from one blockchain to another by locking the tokens in the contract and minting WPAC tokens on the destination chain.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrapto/wpac-erc-20.git
cd wpac-erc-20
npm install
```

## Deploying the Smart Contract

The project uses a unified Hardhat configuration that includes both testnet and mainnet networks. You control which network to use by specifying the network name.

You need to manually adjust parameters in `hardhat.config.ts` such as defining RPC URLs, account private keys, etc.

### Deploying

To deploy to a specific network:

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.ts --network <NETWORK-NAME>
```

### Upgrading

To upgrade on a specific network:

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/upgrade.ts --network <NETWORK-NAME>
```

### Available Networks

**Local Network:**
- `hardhat` - Local Hardhat Network (default network; no network flag needed)

**Testnet Networks:**
- `polygon_amoy` - Polygon Amoy Testnet
- `bsc_testnet` - BSC Testnet
- `base_sepolia` - Base Sepolia Testnet
- `ethereum_sepolia` - Ethereum Sepolia Testnet

**Mainnet Networks:**
- `polygon` - Polygon Mainnet
- `bsc` - BSC Mainnet
- `base` - Base Mainnet
- `ethereum` - Ethereum Mainnet

## Using Trezor Hardware Wallet

To deploy or upgrade using a Trezor hardware wallet, set the `TREZOR_BIP44_PATH` environment variable and then:

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/upgrade.ts --network <NETWORK-NAME>
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run node`: Starts a local Hardhat node for testing.
- `npm run compile`: Compiles the Solidity contracts.
- `npm run clean`: Cleans up artifacts, cache, coverage, and typechain files.
- `npm run lint:sol`: Lints the Solidity contracts using Solhint.
- `npm run lint:ts`: Lints the TypeScript files using ESLint.
- `npm run test`: Runs the Hardhat tests.
- `npm run typechain`: Generates TypeScript bindings for the Solidity contracts.

## Contract Overview

The main contract file is `wpac.sol` which implements the ERC-20 interface.
It also integrates functionality for bridging PAC tokens from one blockchain to another.
The contract is upgradeable and follows the Ownable and Pausable patterns for security and control.

## Project Structure

The main project files and directories are structured as follows:

- `contracts/`: Contains Solidity contracts.
- `test/`: Contains test scripts for the contracts.
- `scripts/`: Contains deployment and upgrade scripts.
- `artifacts/`: Contains contract artifacts generated by Hardhat.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for Node.js dependencies and scripts.
- `hardhat.config.ts`: Hardhat configuration (includes both testnet and mainnet networks).
